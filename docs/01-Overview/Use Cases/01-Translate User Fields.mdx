Once a translation service has been set up, user-inputted fields can be translated for transitory use. Individual fields must be selected one at a time for translation, and the output from the service will not be saved.

### Where it's used

1. Navigate to any page within OpenPages where the translation button appears.

    ![translation button](../../../images/translate_button.png)

2. Depening on what locale the user is in, the button will translate the fields to that target locale language.
    
    *Example below translating Janapese in an English locale*

### How to Implement

The UI-based translation can be configured one of two ways:
1. OpenPages watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai translation service

    To translate using one of the two native translation services (NeuralSeek/watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai), complete the setup process as described in the [product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/openpages/9.0.0?topic=integrations-translation-services). See [here](../../Create/Translate%20User%20Fields/Native%20Translation%20Service) for more information.

2. Custom translation service

    To translate the necessary headers/labels with wx.ai an API wrapper is required to simulate the API response that is expected from the NeuralSeek configuration within OpenPages. Navigate [here](../../Create/Translate%20User%20Fields/Custom%20API%20Endpoint) for a walkthrough on how to implement the API wrapper.
