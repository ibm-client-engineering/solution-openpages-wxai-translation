Aside from the default feature of using the "Locale" to translate the headers and labels, translatations can be carried out through two methods:
* Method 1: Translate Individual Items from the UI.
* Method 2: Translating and reuploading the configuration exports within OpenPages.

## Method 1: Translate Individual Items from the UI.
--------

### Where it's used

Translations on the headers and labels can be carried out on the OpenPages platform through the "System Configuration" and/or "Application Text", etc. by using the connected transltion service.

1. Navigate to the "Open Administrator Menu", select "System Configuration", and select either "Application Text" or "Object Text".

    ![Object Text](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/386696/files/1a50c0d2-bb16-43ab-838a-a0549091a235)

2. Select one of the items in the list, and select "Auto Translate" in the pop-up window on the right to carry out the relevant translations. Click "Done".

    ![Object Text 2](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/386696/files/72a643bc-1d3d-4605-acbb-89f12632b410)


### How to Implement

The UI-based translation can be set up to work with either a native translation service or a custom API wrapper.

To translate using one of the two native translation services (NeuralSeek/watsonx.ai), complete the setup process as described in the [product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/openpages/9.0.0?topic=integrations-translation-services). See [here](../../Create/Translate%20User%20Fields/Native%20Translation%20Service) for more information.

To translate the necessary headers/labels with wx.ai an API wrapper is required to simulate the API response that is expected from the NeuralSeek configuration within OpenPages. Navigate [here](../../Create/Translate%20User%20Fields/Custom%20API%20Endpoint) for a walkthrough on how to implement the API wrapper.



## Method 3: Translate Configuration Export
--------

### Where it's used

Another way to translate the headers/labels for the OpenPages platform is by exporting the necessary configuration files, translating the data, and then re-importing the translated configuration file back into the OpenPages platform.

**Export the configuration**
1. Navigate to the "Open Administrator Menu", select "System Migration", and choose "Export Configuration".

2. Select "Add Items +", choose "Application Text" from the list and select all necessary items and select "Select"

    ![Export Config 2](https://media.github.ibm.com/user/386696/files/f32ccb19-cd94-443a-8b50-0d77e84fede2)

**Translate the exported configuration file with wx.ai**

Use the parse_config.py file under the Translate Configuration Export folder of [this repository](https://github.com/ibm-client-engineering/solution-openpages-wxai-translation) to parse the XML config file and translate the non-translated fields.

:::info
The code as it is currently written is intended for translating English fields to Japanese. The program will check using a regex parser for Japanese text to verify whether or not that field needs to be translated. You may need to implement a different system to check if a field should be translated.
:::
:::info
The configuration export file also includes code for downloading an excel file from OpenPages to use as a preset dictionary to check for BEFORE using generative AI to translate. You may or may not want to use a system like this.
:::

**Import the configuration**
1. Navigate to the "Open Administrator Menu", select "System Migration", and choose either "Import Configuration".
