Aside from the default feature of using the "Locale" to translate the headers and labels, translatations can be carried out through two methods:
* **Method 1:** Translate Individual Items from the UI.
* **Method 2:** Translating and reuploading the configuration exports within OpenPages.

## Method 1: Translate Individual Items from the UI.
--------

Translations on the headers and labels can be carried out on the OpenPages platform through the UI by using the connected translation service. You can learn more [here](../../Create/Translate%20Headers%20and%20Labels). This is a manual, one-field-at-a-time process, and also allows for manual translation input. This is useful if you are trying to just adjust a single header/label's translation, but if you want a broader translation you should probably export the configuration, translate that, then reimport it. 

The UI-based translation can be set up to work with either a native translation service or a custom API wrapper. To translate using one of the two native translation services (NeuralSeek/watson<span style={{ color: '#3a60f6' }}>x</span>.ai), complete the setup process as described in the [product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/openpages/9.0.0?topic=integrations-translation-services). See [here](../../Create/Translate%20User%20Fields/Native%20Translation%20Service) for more information.


## Method 2: Translate Configuration Export
--------

Another way to translate the headers/labels for the OpenPages platform is by exporting the necessary configuration files, translating the data, and then re-importing the translated configuration file back into the OpenPages platform. You can learn more [here](../../Create/Translate%20Headers%20and%20Labels).
